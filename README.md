# 👋 Hello. Welcome to my GitHub

I'm Arriella Mafuta, a passionate individual with a love for code, technology, and creativity. Here's a little about me:

## 🚀 About Me

- 🌍 I'm currently based in Philadelphia, PA, though born and raised in Lusaka, Zambia.
- 🎓 Currently studying at the University of Pennsylvania, pursuing a BSE in Computer Science.
- 💡 I love exploring new technologies and finding innovative solutions to problems.
- 🎨 In my free time, I enjoy volleyball, reading books, and immersing myself in different cultures and languages.

## 💻 Technical Interests & Skills

I'm always looking to broaden my skills and always open to learning new technologies, but currently:

- **Languages:** Python, Java, Ocaml
- **Web Development (in progress):** HTML, CSS, Javascript
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## 🌟 Projects

Here are a few projects that I have worked on:

1. **Fluid Modeling:** Created a model simulation of intricate fluid flow structures using Python and numerical integration methods for data analysis.

2. **Simple Game Projects:** Developed interactive games (Minesweeper and Othello) using Java Swing
   
3.  *Upcoming project....a Chrome Extension*


## 💼 Adventures in the Professional Realm

As an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant at the University of Pennsylvania, 
I lead weekly recitation sessions on Algorithms and Data Structures. My role involves demystifying complex concepts to enhance student comprehension
and contribute to the success of students, by stimulating an intuitive way of thinking to solve problems involving Algorithms and Data Structures.

My summer at the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception Lab (Penn GRASP Lab),
I had a great opportunity to work with a wonderful team of Graduate Students and explores concepts involving mathematical modeling and fluid dynamics.

## 🌐 Connecting Beyond Code
As the Board Representative of External Affairs for the National Society of Black Engineers,
I'm not just pushing code; I'm pushing for diversity in STEM at Penn. Collaborating with industry partners and community organizations,
I'm on a mission to break barriers and build bridges.

Being a part of the FemmeHacks Team in Women in Computer Science is my way of lighting the torch for women in tech. 
Contributing to organizing the Annual FemmeHacks Hackathon, I'm fostering a community where ideas flourish, and women thrive.

I also spend my time mentoring 15+ prospective international students. I'm not just a mentor; I'm a guide, a friend, helping navigate the exciting journey of university applications.

## 🌐 Connect with Me!

I'm open to collaboration and always excited to connect with fellow developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts.
